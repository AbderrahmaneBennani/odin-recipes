        <h3>Rfissa Recipe</h4>
        <p>Rfissa is a fabulous Moroccan dish of stewed chicken, lentils, and onions served on a bed of shredded msemen, trid pastry or bread. A fragrantly seasoned broth is poured over all.</p>
        <h3>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Making and shredding msemen is best done ahead of time. Tear the msemen into bite-size pieces while hot off the griddle. When cool, store in a plastic bag. If prepared more than a day in advance, freeze the shredded msemen until needed.</li>
            <li>The night before (or at least six hours before cooking), soak the fenugreek seeds and lentils in separate bowls of cold water. (If you forget to do this, you can do a quick soak by pouring boiling water over the fenugreek and lentils and letting them sit an hour or two.) Drain when ready to use. </li>
            <li>Place the pot with the chicken on the stove over medium heat and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, for about 15 to 20 minutes, until a rich sauce has formed. </li>
            <li>Taste the broth for salt, then add the smen, swirling the pot to incorporate it into the broth. If desired, remove the chicken from the pot and place it under a broiler for a few minutes to brown and crisp the skin.</li>
        </ol>
